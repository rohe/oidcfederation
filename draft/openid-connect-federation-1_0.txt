                OpenID Connect Federation 1.0 - draft 09
                     openid-connect-federation-1_0

Abstract

   The OpenID Connect standard specifies how a Relying Party (RP) can
   discover metadata about an OpenID Provider (OP), and then register to
   obtain RP credentials.  The discovery and registration process does
   not involve any mechanisms of dynamically establishing trust in the
   exchanged information, but instead rely on out-of-band trust
   establishment.

   In an identity federation context, this is not sufficient.  The
   participants of the federation must be able to trust information
   provided about other participants in the federation.  OpenID Connect
   Federations specifies how trust can be dynamically obtained by
   resolving trust from a common trusted third party.

   While this specification is primarily targeting OpenID Connect, it is
   designed to allow for re-use by other protocols and in other use
   cases.

1.  Introduction

   This specification describes how two entities that would like to
   interact can dynamically fetch and resolve trust and metadata for a
   given protocol through the use of third-party trust issuers.  A trust
   issuer is an entity whose main purpose is to issue statements about
   entities, such as OpenID Connect Relying Parties, OpenID Providers,



Hedberg, et al.         Expires February 19, 2020               [Page 3]

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   and participating organizations.  An identity federation can be
   realized using this specification using one or more levels of trust
   issuers.  This specification does not mandate a specific way or
   restrict how a federation may be built.  Instead, the specification
   provides the basic technical trust infrastructure building blocks
   needed to build a dynamic and distributed trust network such as a
   federation.

   All entities in an OpenID Connect federation MUST have a globally
   unique identifier.

   Note that a company, as with any real-world organization, may be
   represented by more than one entity in a federation.

   OpenID Connect Federation trust chains rely on cryptographically
   signed JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] documents, and the trust chain
   does not at all rely on TLS [RFC8446] in order to establish trust.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Claim Name", "Claim Value", "JSON
   Web Token (JWT)", defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] and the
   terms "OpenID Provider (OP)" and "Relying Party (RP)" defined by
   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   This specification also defines the following terms:

   Entity
      Something that has a separate and distinct existence and that can
      be identified in a context.

   Entity statement
      An entity statement is issued by an entity, which pertains to a
      subject entity and leaf entities.  An entity statement is always a
      signed JWT.

   Intermediate entity
      An entity that issues an entity statement that appears somewhere
      in between those issued by the trust anchor and the leaf entity in
      a trust chain.

   Leaf Entity

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


      An entity defined by a certain protocol, e.g., OpenID Connect
      Relying Party or Provider.

   Trust Anchor
      An entity that represents a trusted third party.

   Trust Chain
      A sequence of entity statements that represents a chain starting
      at a leaf entity and ending in a trust anchor.

2.  Components

2.1.  Entity Statement

   An entity statement is issued by an entity and concerns a subject
   entity and leaf entities in a federation.  An entity statement is
   always a signed JWT.  All entities in a federation SHOULD be prepared
   to publish an entity statement about themselves.  If they are not
   able to do so themselves someone else MUST do it for them.

   An entity statement is composed of the following claims:

   iss
      REQUIRED.  The entity identifier of the issuer of the statement.
      If the "iss" and the "sub" are identical, the issuer is making a
      statement about itself.

   sub
      REQUIRED.  The entity identifier of the subject

   iat
      REQUIRED.  The time the statement was issued.  Its value is a JSON
      number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z
      as measured in UTC until the date/time.  See RFC 3339 [RFC3339]
      for details regarding date/times in general and UTC in particular.

   exp
      REQUIRED.  Expiration time on or after which the statement MUST
      NOT be accepted for processing.  Its value is a JSON number
      representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as
      measured in UTC until the date/time.

   jwks
      REQUIRED.  A JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) [RFC7517] representing the
      public part of the subject entity's signing keys.  The
      corresponding private key is used by leaf entities to sign entity
      statements about themselves, and intermediate entities to sign
      statements about other entities.  The keys that can be found here



Hedberg, et al.         Expires February 19, 2020               [Page 5]

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


      are primarily intended to sign entity statements and should not be
      used in other protocols.

   aud
      OPTIONAL.  The entity statement may be specifically created for a
      entity.  The entity identifier for that entity should appear in
      this claim.

   authority_hints
      OPTIONAL.  Array of strings representing the entity IDs of
      intermediate entities that may issue an entity statement about the
      issuer entity.

   metadata
      REQUIRED.  JSON object including protocol specific metadata claims
      that represent the entity's metadata.  Each key of the JSON object
      represents a metadata type identifier, and each value MUST be a
      JSON object representing the metadata according to the metadata
      schema of that metadata type.  An entity statement may contain
      multiple metadata statements, but only one for each metadata type.
      If the entity is a non-leaf entity it MUST contain a metadata
      object with a "federation_entity" object inside.

   metadata_policy
      OPTIONAL.  JSON object that describes a metadata policy.  Each key
      of the JSON object represents a metadata type identifier, and each
      value MUST be a JSON object representing the metadata policy
      according to the metadata schema of that metadata type.  An entity
      statement may contain multiple metadata policy statements, but
      only one for each metadata type.  If the metadata type identifier
      is "federation_entity", then the policy MUST be applied to the
      immediate subordinate in the trust chain unless that is a leaf
      entity.  If the metadata type identifier is not
      "federation_entity", then the policy MUST be applied to all
      subordinate nodes of that type in the trust chain.  Only non-leaf
      entities MAY contain a "metadata_policy" claim.  Leaf entities
      MUST NOT contain a metadata_policy claim.

   crit
      OPTIONAL.  The "crit" (critical) entity statement claim indicates
      that extensions to entity statement claims defined by this
      specification are being used that MUST be understood and
      processed.  It is used in the same way that "crit" is used for
      extension JWS [RFC7515] header parameters that MUST be understood
      and processed.  Its value is an array listing the entity statement
      claims present in the entity statement that use those extensions.
      If any of the listed extension entity statement claims are not
      understood and supported by the recipient, then the entity

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


      statement is invalid.  Producers MUST NOT include entity statement
      claim names defined by this specification or names that do not
      occur as entity statement claim names in the entity statement in
      the "crit" list.  Producers MUST NOT use the empty list "[]" as
      the "crit" value.

   policy_language_crit
      OPTIONAL.  The "policy_language_crit" (critical) entity statement
      claim indicates that extensions to the policy language defined by
      this specification are being used that MUST be understood and
      processed.  It is used in the same way that "crit" is used for
      extension JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515] header parameters
      that MUST be understood and processed.  Its value is an array
      listing the policy language extensions present in the policy
      language statements that use those extensions.  If any of the
      listed extension policy language extensions are not understood and
      supported by the recipient, then the entity statement is invalid.
      Producers MUST NOT include policy language names defined by this
      specification or names that do not occur in policy language
      statements in the entity statement in the "policy_language_crit"
      list.  Producers MUST NOT use the empty list "[]" as the
      "policy_language_crit" value.

   The entity statement is signed using the private key of the issuer
   entity, in the form of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515].

   The following is a non-normative example of an entity statement,
   before serialization and adding a signature.  The example contains a
   critical extension "jti" (JWT ID) to the entity statement and one
   critical extension to the policy language "regexp" (Regular
   expression).

2.2.  Trust Chain

   In an OpenID Connect Identity Federation, entities that together
   build a trust chain can be categorized as:

   Trust anchor
      An entity that represents a trusted third party

   Leaf
      In an OpenID Connect Identity Federation, an RP or an OP

   Intermediate
      Neither a leaf nor a trust anchor

   A trust chain begins with a leaf entity's self-signed entity
   statement, has zero or more entity statements issued by intermediates
   about subordinates, and ends with an entity statement issued by the
   trust anchor about the top-most intermediate (if there are
   intermediates) or the leaf entity (if there are no intermediates).

   A simple example: If we have a RP that belongs to organization A that
   is a member of federation F, the trust chain for such a setup will
   contain the following entity statements:

   1.  A self-signed entity statement about the RP published by the RP

   2.  An entity statement about the RP published by Organization A

   3.  An entity statement about Organization A published by Federation
       F

   A trust chain MUST always be possible to order such that: If we name
   the entity statements ES[0] (the leaf entity's self-signed entity
   statement) to ES[i] (an entity statement issued by the trust anchor),
   i>0 then:

   o  The "iss" entity in one entity statement is always the "sub"
      entity in the next.  ES[j]['iss'] == ES[j+1]['sub'], j=0,...,i-1

   o  There MUST always be a signing key carried in the "jwks" claim in
      ES[j] that can be used to verify the signature of ES[j-1],
      j=i,...,1 .

   The signing key that MUST be used to verify ES[i] is distributed from
   the trust anchors to the leaf entities in some secure out-of-band's
   way not described in this document.

3.  Metadata

   This specification does allow new metadata types to be defined, to
   support use cases outside OpenID Connect federations.  The metadata
   type identifier will uniquely identify which metadata specification
   to utilize.

   The metadata document MUST be a JSON document.  Beyond that there is
   no restriction.

   Metadata used in federations typically re-uses existing metadata
   standards.  If needed, the metadata schema is extended with
   additional properties relevant in a federated context.  For instance,
   for OpenID Connect Federations, this specification uses metadata
   values from OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 [OpenID.Discovery] and
   OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration]
   and adds additional values used for federations.

3.1.  RP Metadata

   The metadata type identifier is "openid_relying_party".

   All parameters defined in Section 2 of OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
   Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration] are allowed in a metadata
   statement.

   To that list is added:

   federation_type
      REQUIRED.  Array of strings specifying the federation types
      supported.  Values defined by this specification are "automatic"
      and "explicit".

   organization_name
      OPTIONAL.  A human readable name representing the organization
      owning the RP.

3.2.  OP Metadata

   The metadata type identifier is "openid_provider".

   All parameters defined in Section 3 of OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0
   [OpenID.Discovery] are applicable.

   In addition, the following parameters are defined by this
   specification:

   federation_types_supported

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


      REQUIRED.  Array specifying the federation types supported.
      Federation type values defined by this specification are
      "automatic" and "explicit".

   organization_name
      OPTIONAL.  A human readable name representing the organization
      owning the OP.  It is intended to be used in the user interface,
      being recognized by the end users that would be using the OP to
      authenticate.

   federation_registration_endpoint
      OPTIONAL.  URL of the OP's Federation specific Dynamic Client
      Registration Endpoint.  If the OP supports explicit client
      registration as described inSection 9.2, then this claim is
      REQUIRED.

3.3.  OAuth Authorization Server

   The metadata type identifier is "oauth_authorization_server".

   All parameters defined in Section 2 of RFC 8414 [RFC8414] are
   applicable.

3.4.  OAuth Client

   The metadata type identifier is "oauth_client".

   All parameters defined in Section 2 of RFC 7591 [RFC7591]

3.5.  OAuth Protected Resource

   The metadata type identifier is "oauth_resource".

3.6.  Federation Entity

   The metadata type identifier is "federation_entity".

   All entities participating in a federation are of this type.

   The following properties are allowed:

   federation_api_endpoint
      OPTIONAL.  The endpoint used for the Federation API described in
      Section 6.  Intermediate entities and trust anchors MUST publish a
      federation_api_endpoint.

   trust_anchor_id

      OPTIONAL An OP MUST used this to tell the RP which trust anchor it
      chose to use when responding to an explicit client registration.

   name
      OPTIONAL.  String.  The human readable name describing the subject
      entity.  This may be, for example, the name of an organization.

   contacts
      OPTIONAL.  JSON array with one or more strings.  Contact persons
      at the entity.  These may contain names, e-mail addresses,
      descriptions, phone numbers, etc.

   policy_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL to documentation of conditions and policies
      relevant to this entity.

   homepage_uri
      OPTIONAL.  URL to a generic home page representing this entity.

      below this entity.

   naming_constraints
      OPTIONAL.  JSON object.  Restriction on the entity IDs of the
      entities below this entity.  The behavior of this claim mimics
      what is defined in section 4.2.1.10 in RFC5280 [RFC5280].
      Restrictions are defined in terms of permitted or excluded name
      subtrees.

   "federation_entity": {
       "federation_api_endpoint":
           "https://example.com/federation_api_endpoint",

4.  Applying Policy to Metadata

   The metadata for a specific entity can be constructed by starting
   with the information in a leaf entity's entity statement and then
   applying the policies defined by the trust anchor and possible
   intermediates starting with the trust anchor.

4.1.  Policy Language

   Policies are expressed using a JSON object.

   The following keywords represent different actions/checks that MUST
   be applied to the metadata.

4.1.1.  subset_of

   The resulting value of the claim will be the intersection of the
   values specified here and the values of the claim.  For instance, the
   claim policy:

     "response_types": {
       "subset_of": ["code", "code token", "code id_token"]}

   if applied to a metadata statement with:

     "response_types": ["code", "code id_token token", "code id_token"]

   will update the claim in the metadata statement to be:

     "response_types": ["code", "code id_token"]

4.1.2.  one_of

   The value of the claim MUST be one of the ones listed here.  As an
   example, if the claim policy:

     "request_object_signing_alg": {
       "one_of": ["ES256", "ES384", "ES512"]}

   is applied to the metadata statement

     "request_object_signing_alg": "ES384"

   the resulting claim statement will be:

     "request_object_signing_alg": "ES384"





Hedberg, et al.         Expires February 19, 2020              [Page 13]

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   If an entity tries to register a value that is not in the "one_of"
   set of values.  Applying the policy MUST lead to a failure.

4.1.3.  superset_of

   The values of the claim MUST contain the ones listed here.  As an
   example, if the claim policy:

    "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": {
       "superset": ["ES256", "RS256"]}

   is applied to the metadata statement

   "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": [
     "ES256", "ES384", "RS256", "RS512"]

   the resulting claim statement will be:

   "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": [
     "ES256", "ES384", "RS256", "RS512"]

   If an entity tries to register a set of values that are not a
   superset of the ones specified by "superset_of".  Applying the policy
   MUST lead to a failure.

4.1.4.  add

   Adds the value or values specified to the list of values for the
   metadata statement claim.  If the specified value is already present
   in the list, this operation has no effect.  As an example, if the
   claim policy:

     "contacts": {
       "add": "support@federation.example.com"}

   is applied to the following claim in the metadata statement:

     "contacts": "support@org.example.com"

   the end result will be the claim:

     "contacts": ["support@org.example.com",
                  "support@federation.example.com"]

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


4.1.5.  value

   Disregarding what value the claim had, if any, the claims value will
   be set to what is specified here.  As an example, if the claim
   policy:

     "require_auth_time": {
       "value": true}

   is applied to a metadata statement with the claim

     "require_auth_time": false

   then the metadata statement will afterwards contain:

     "require_auth_time": true

4.1.6.  default

   If no value is assigned to this claim, then the claim's value will be
   set to what is specified here.  As an example, if the claim policy:

     "require_auth_time": {
       "default": true }

   is applied to a metadata statement with the claim

     "require_auth_time": false

   then the metadata statement will afterwards contain:

     "require_auth_time": false

   if on the other hand the metadata statement did not contain a
   "require_auth_time" claim then the following claim statement would be
   added to the metadata statement:

     "require_auth_time": true

4.1.7.  essential

   If 'true' then claim MUST have a value.  "essential" can be combined
   with all the other types.

     "tos_uri": {
       "essential": true}

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   The upshot of applying this policy to a metadata statement is that
   the metadata statement MUST contain such a claim otherwise the
   metadata statement is incorrect.

4.2.  Policy Type Combinations

   An entity may use more then one policy type when expressing a policy
   for a claim.  These are the policy types that can be combined in a
   metadata_policy statement:

   essential
      Can be combined with all the others.  If "essential" is not
      present that is the same as stating essential=true.

   default
      Can be combined with "one_of", "subset_of" and "superset_of".  If
      a "default" policy is combined with "one_of", "subset_of" or
      "superset_of" and it is not a subset of the "subset_of" policy or
      the "one_of" policy or a superset of the "superset_of" policy then
      an error MUST be raised.

   superset_of
      Can be combined with "subset_of".  If "subset_of" and
      "superset_of" both appears in a metadata_policy statement
      "subset_of" MUST be a superset of "superset_of".

4.3.  Combining Policies

   If there is more than one metadata policy in a trust chain, then the
   policies MUST be combined before they are applied to the metadata
   statement.

   Using the notation we have defined in Section 2.2 policies are
   combined starting with ES[i] and then adding the policies from ES[j]
   j=i-1,..,1 before applying the combined policy to the entity's
   metadata

   After having combined the policies, the policy for each claim MUST
   adhere to the rules defined inSection 4.2.

   These are the policy types that can be combined when combining two
   policies:

   subset_of
      The result of combining two "subset_of" policies is the
      intersection of the values.

   one_of

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


      The result of combining two "one_of" policies is the intersection
      of the values.

   superset_of
      The result of combining two "superset_of" policies is the
      intersection of the values.

   add
      The result of combining two "add" policies is the union of the
      values.

   value
      The result of combining two "value" policies is NOT allowed unless
      the two values are equal.

   default
      The result of combining two "default" policies is NOT allowed
      unless the two values are equal.

   essential
      The result of combining two "essential" policies is True if any of
      the values are True otherwise it is False.  Note that a missing
      "essential" specification is to be treated as an essential=true
      statement.

4.3.1.  Policy Combination Example

   A federations policy for RPs:

   {
       "scopes": {
           "subset_of": ["openid", "eduperson", "phone"],
           "superset_of": ["openid"],
           "default": ["openid", "eduperson"]},
       "id_token_signed_response_alg": {
           "one_of": ["ES256", "ES384", "ES512"]},
       "contacts": {
           "add": "helpdesk@federation.example.org"},
       "application_type": {"value": "web"}
   }

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   An organization's policy for RPs:

   {
       "scopes": {
           "subset_of": ["openid", "eduperson", "address"],
           "default": ["openid", "eduperson"]},
       "id_token_signed_response_alg": {
           "one_of": ["ES256", "ES384"],
           "default": "ES256"},
       "contacts": {
           "add": "helpdesk@org.example.org"},
   }

   The combined metadata policy then becomes:

   {
       "scopes": {
           "subset_of": ["openid", "eduperson"],
           "superset_of": ["openid"],
           "default": ["openid", "eduperson"]},
       "id_token_signed_response_alg": {
           "one_of": ["ES256", "ES384"],
           "default": "ES256"},
       "contacts": {
           "add": ["helpdesk@federation.example.org",
                   "helpdesk@org.example.org"]},
       "application_type": {
           "value": "web"}
   }

4.4.  Enforcing Policy

   If applying a policy to a metadata statement results in some claims
   having all their values removed and it is essential that a claim has
   a value, then such a metadata statement MUST be regarded as broken
   and MUST NOT be used.

4.5.  Extending the Policy Language

   There might be parties that want to extend the policy language
   defined here.  If that happens then the rule is that if software
   compliant with this specification encounters a keyword it doesn't
   understand it MUST ignore it unless it is listed in a
   "policy_language_crit " list, as is done for JWS [RFC7515] header
   parameters with the "crit" parameter.  If the policy language
   extension keyword is listed in the "policy_language_crit" list and
   not understood, then the metadata MUST be rejected.

4.6.  Policy Example

   The following is a non-normative example of a set of policies being
   applied to an RP's metadata.

   The RP's metadata:

   {
     "contacts": ["rp_admins@cs.example.com"],
     "redirect_uris": ["https://cs.example.com/rp1"],
     "response_types: ["code"]
   }

   The federations policy for RPs:

   {
       "scopes": {
           "superset_of": ["openid", "eduperson"],
           "default": ["openid", "eduperson"]
       },
       "response_types": {
           "subset_of": ["code", "code id_token"]}
   }

   The organization's policy for RPs:

   {
     "contacts": {
       "add": "helpdesk@example.com"},
     "logo_uri": {
       "one_of": ["https://example.com/logo_small.jpg",
                  "https://example.com/logo_big.jpg"],
       "default": "https://example.com/logo_small.jpg"
     },
     "policy_uri": {
       "value": "https://example.com/policy.html"},
     "tos_uri": {
       "value": "https://example.com/tos.html"}
   }

   The metadata for the entity in question after applying the policies
   above, would then become:

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   {
     "contacts": ["rp_admins@cs.example.com", "helpdesk@example.com"],
     "logo_uri": "https://example.com/logo_small.jpg",
     "policy_uri": "https://example.com/policy.html",
     "tos_uri": "https://example.com/tos.html"
     "scopes": ["openid", "eduperson"],
     "response_types": ["code"],
     "redirect_uris": ["https://cs.example.com/rp1"]
   }

5.  Obtaining Federation Entity Configuration Information

   The configuration endpoint is found using the Well-Known URIs
   [RFC8615] specification, with the suffix "openid-federation".  The
   scheme, host and port is taken directly from the entity identifier
   combined with the following path: "/.well-known/openid-federation".

   If the entity identifier contains a path, it is concatenated after
   "/.well-known/openid-federation" in the same manner that path
   components are concatenated to the well-known identifier in the OAuth
   2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414] specification.  Of
   course, in real multi-tenant deployments, in which the entity ID
   might be of the form "https://multi-tenant-service.example.com/my-
   tenant-identifier " the tenant is very likely to not have control
   over the path "https://multi-tenant-service.example.com/.well-known/
   openid-federation/my-tenant-identifier " whereas it is very likely to
   have control over the path "https://multi-tenant-service.example.com/
   my-tenant-identifier/.well-known/openid-federation " .  Therefore, if
   using the Federation API at the URL with the tenant path after the
   well-known part fails, it is RECOMMENDED that callers retry at the
   URL with the tenant path before the well-known part (even though this
   violates[RFC8615])

   Federation Entities MUST make a metadata statement available at the
   configuration endpoint.

5.1.  Federation Entity Configuration Request

   An federation Entity Configuration Document MUST be queried using an
   HTTP GET request at the previously specified path.  The requesting
   party would make the following request to the Entity
   "https://example.com" to obtain its Configuration information:


     GET /.well-known/openid-federation HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


5.2.  Federation Entity Configuration Response

   The response is a Entity Statement as described in entity statement
   (Section 2.1).  If the entity is an intermediate entity or a trust
   anchor the response MUST contain metadata for a federation entity.

   If the entity is an intermediate entity or a trust anchor it will
   only contain metadata for a federation entity.

   An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

   The following is a non-normative example response from an
   intermediate entity, before serialization and adding a signature:

   {
     "iss": "https://example.com",
     "sub": "https://example.com",
     "iat": 1516239022,
     "exp": 1516298022,
     "jti": "7l2lncFdY6SlhNia",
     "metadata": {

6.  The Federation API

   All entities that are expected to publish entity statements about
   other entities, MUST expose a Federation API endpoint.

   The federation API endpoint of an entity can be found the in the
   configuration response as described in Section 5 or by other means.

   The Federation API is an HTTPS API that may support multiple
   operations.  Fetching entity statements is one of the operations, and
   the only one that all Federation API endpoints are REQUIRED to
   support.  All the other operations are OPTIONAL.  The list of defined
   operations may be extended in a future.

   While all operations in the specification make use of a GET request,
   other operations may choose to use other HTTP methods.  If the
   "operation" parameter is left out, it is treated as a fetch entity
   statements request.  Unless otherwise mentioned or agreed upon,
   requests to the federation API do not need to be authenticated.

6.1.  Fetching Entity Statement (REQUIRED)

   Fetching entity statement is used to collect entity statements one by
   one in order to gather trust chains.

   In order to fetch an entity statement, an entity needs to know the
   identifier of the entity to ask (the issuer), the federation API
   endpoint of that entity and the identifier of the entity that you
   want the statement to be about (the subject).

6.1.1.  Fetch Entity Statements Request

   The request MUST be an HTTP request using the GET method and the
   https scheme to a resolved federation API endpoint with the following
   query string parameters:

   operation
      OPTIONAL.  If not present, MUST be treated as "fetch".

   iss
      REQUIRED.  The entity identifier of the issuer from which you want
      an entity statement issued.  Because of the normalization of the
      URL, multiple issuers may resolve to a shared federation API.
      This parameter makes it explicit exactly which issuer we want
      entity statements from.

   sub

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


      OPTIONAL.  The entity identifier of the subject for which you
      would like an entity statement issued.  If this parameter is left
      out, it is considered to be the same as the issuer and would
      indicate a request for a self-issued statement.

   aud
      OPTIONAL.  The entity identifier of the requester.  The issuing
      entity may choose to include this parameter to form the entity
      statement specifically for this target, in which the "aud" claim
      also SHOULD be present in the entity statement self.

   The following is a non-normative example of an API request for an
   entity statement:

   GET /federation_api_endpoint?
   iss=https%3A%2F%2Fopenid.sunet.se%2Ffederation HTTP/1.1
   Host: openid.sunet.se

6.1.2.  Fetch Entity Statements Response

   A positive response is a signed entity statement where the content
   type MUST be set to "application/jose".  If it is negative response
   it will be a JSON object and the content type MUST be set to
   "application/json".  See more about error responses inSection 6.4.

6.2.  Trust Negotiation (OPTIONAL)

   An entity may use the trust negotiation operation in order to fetch
   resolved metadata about itself as seen/trusted by a remote peer.  The
   result may, for instance, tell an RP what operations, scopes and

   claims an OP would allow the RP to use if a specific trust anchor was
   used.

6.2.1.  Trust Negotiation Request

   The request MUST be an HTTP request using the GET method and the
   https scheme to a resolved federation API endpoint with the following
   query string parameters:

   operation
      REQUIRED.  MUST be set to "resolve_metadata".

   respondent
      REQUIRED.  The entity identifier of the entity whose metadata are
      requested.  Because of the normalization of the URL, multiple
      entity identifiers may resolve to a shared federation API.  This
      parameter makes it explicit exactly which entity is expected.

   peer
      REQUIRED.  The entity identifier of the entity the information is
      requested for.  This must be a leaf entity.

   type
      REQUIRED.  The metadata type to resolve.  In this document, we use
      the metadata types listed in Section 3.

   anchor
      REQUIRED.  The trust anchor the remote peer MUST use when
      resolving the metadata.

   The following is a non-normative example of an API request for trust
   negotiation:

   GET /federation_api_endpoint?
   operation=resolve_metadata&
   respondent=https%3A%2F%2Fopenid.sunet.se%2Ffederation&

   The response is a metadata statement that is the result of applying
   the metadata policies in the trust chain on the entity's metadata.

      entity listing is requested.  Because of the normalization of the
      URL, multiple entity identifiers may resolve to a shared
      federation API.  This parameter makes it explicit exactly which

7.  Resolving Trust Chain and Metadata

   An entity (e.g., the Consumer) that wants to establish trust with a
   remote peer, must have the remote peer's entity identifier and a list
   of entity IDs of trusted trust anchors together with the public
   version of their signing keys.  The Consumer will first have to fetch
   sufficient entity statements to establish at least one chain of trust
   from the remote peer to one or more of the configured trust anchors.
   After that the entity MUST validate the trust chains independently,
   and -- if there are multiple valid trust chains and if the
   application demands it -- choose one.

7.1.  Fetching Entity Statements to Establish a Trust Chain

   Depending on the circumstances, the Consumer may either be handed the
   remote peer's self-issued entity statement, or it may have to fetch
   it by itself.  If it needs to fetch it, it will use the process
   described in Section 6.1.1 with both "iss" and "sub" set to the
   entity ID of the remote peer.

   The next step is to iterate through the list of intermediates listed
   in "authority_hints", ignoring the authority hints that end in an
   unknown trust anchor, requesting an entity statement about the remote
   peer from each of the intermediates.  If the received entity
   statement contains an authority hint this process is repeated.  This
   time with the "iss" set to the intermediates entity ID and the "sub"
   to be the "iss" of the previous query.  The Consumer should never
   attempt to fetch entity statements it already has fetched during this
   process (loop prevention).






Hedberg, et al.         Expires February 19, 2020              [Page 28]

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   Once the Consumer has found a trust anchor it wants to use it MUST
   complete the trust chain by fetching the trust anchor's self-signed
   entity statement.

   A successful operation will return one or more lists of entity
   statements.  Each of the lists terminating in a self-signed entity
   statement issued by a trust anchor.

   If there is no path from the remote peer to at least one of the
   trusted trust anchors, then the list will be empty and there is no
   way of establishing trust in the remote peer's information.  How the
   Consumer deals with this is out of scope for this specification.

7.2.  Validating the Trust Chains

   As described inSection 2.2, a trust chain consists of an ordered list
   of entity statements.  So whichever way the Consumer has acquired the
   set of entity statements, it must now verify that it is a proper
   trust chain using the rules laid out in that section.

   To validate the chain, the following must be done:

   o  For each entity statement ES[j] j=i,..,0:

      *  Verify that the statement contains all the required claims.

      *  Verify that "iat" has a value in the past

      *  Verify that "exp" has a value that is in the future.

   o  For j=0,i verify that "iss" == "sub".

   o  For j=1,...,i-1: Verify that ES[j]['iss'] == ES[j+1]['sub']

   o  For j=0,...,i-1: Verify the signature of ES[j] using the public
      key carried in ES[j+1]['jwks'].

   o  For j == i: verify the signature with the configured public key of
      the trust anchor.

   Verifying the signature is a much more expensive operation then
   verifying the correctness of the statement and the timestamps.  An
   implementer MAY therefor chose to not verify the signature until all
   the other checks have been done.

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


7.3.  Choosing One of the Valid Trust Chains

   If multiple valid trust chains are found, the Consumer will need to
   decide on which one to use.

   One simple rule would be to prefer a shorter chain over a longer one.

7.4.  Calculating the Lifetime of a Trust Chain

   Each entity statement in a trust chain is signed and MUST have a
   expiration time (exp) set.  The expiration time of the whole trust
   chain is set to the minimum value of exp within the chain.

8.  Updating Metadata, Key Rollover, and Revocation

   This specification allows for a smooth process of updating metadata
   and public keys.

   As described above inSection 7.4, each trust chain has an expiration
   time.  A consumer of metadata using this specification MUST support
   refreshing a trust chain when it expires.  How often a consumer
   SHOULD re-evaluate the trust chain depends on how quickly the
   consumer wants to find out that something has changed in the trust
   chain.

8.1.  Protocol Key Rollover

   If a leaf entity publishes its public keys in the metadata part using
   "jwks", setting an expiration time on the self-signed entity
   statement can be used to control how often the remote party is
   fetching an updated version of the public key.

   If a leaf entity uses "jwks_uri", the remote party will in the normal
   OpenID Connect way fetch the keys anew from the "jwks_uri" URI when
   it discovers that the entity uses a key it has never seen before.

8.2.  Key Rollover for a Trust Anchor

   A trust anchor must publish a self-signed entity statement about
   itself.  As described above inSection 2.2, it should be at the end of
   the trust chain.  The trust anchor SHOULD set a reasonable expiration
   time on that statement, such that the consumers will re-fetch the
   entity statement at reasonable intervals.  If the trust anchor wants
   to roll over its signing keys it would have to:

   1.  Add the new keys to the "jwks" representing the trust anchors
       signing keys.




Hedberg, et al.         Expires February 19, 2020              [Page 30]

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   2.  Keep signing the entity statement using the old keys for a long
       enough time period to allow all subordinates to have gotten
       access to the new keys.

   3.  Switch to signing with the new keys.

   4.  After a reasonable time period remove the old keys.  What is
       regarded as a reasonable time is dependent on the security
       profile and risk assessment of the trust anchor.

   It must be taken into consideration that clients may have manually
   configured pubic keys as part of their configuration.

8.3.  Revocation

   Since the consumers are expected to check the trust chain at regular,
   reasonably frequent times, this specification does not specify a
   standard revocation process.  Specific federations may make a
   different choice and will then have to add such a process.

9.  OpenID Connect Communication

   This section describes how the trust framework in this specification
   is used to establish trust between an RP and an OP that has no
   explicit configuration or registration in advance.

   There are two alternative approaches to establish trust between an RP
   and an OP, which we call automatic and explicit registration.
   Members of a federation or a community should agree upon which one to
   use.  While implementations should support both methods, deployments
   may choose to disable the use of one of them.

9.1.  Automatic Registration

   The trust between the entities is established using the above
   described extensions in the first two steps of the communication
   between an RP and an OP.  How the RP found the OP in the first place
   is out of scope for this document.

   ------                                       ------
   |    | <--- 1) Discovery ------------------> |    |
   | RP | ---- 2) Authentication request -----> | OP |
   |    |                                       |    |
   ------                                       ------

   The "client_id" of the RP MUST be set identically to the RP entity
   identifier.

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   Without a registration process, the RP does not have a client_secret.
   Instead the automatic registration model requires the RP to make use
   of asymmetric cryptography.

   The RP MUST host a Federation API that allows the OP to fetch the
   entity statements.

9.1.1.  The Authentication Request

   The authentication request is as specified in OpenID Connect Core.

   The RP MUST authenticate at the authentication endpoint using the
   private_key_jwt method described in the client authentication section
   of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].

   An authentication request example:

   GET /authorization?
     redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fauthz_cb
     &scope=openid+profile+email+address+phone
     &response_type=code
     &nonce=4LX0mFMxdBjkGmtx7a8WIOnB&
     &state=YmX8PM9I7WbNoMnnieKKBiptVW0sP2OZ
     &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8090%2Firp
     &client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs ... qx7xHcvPOdIhnpg
     &client_assertion_type=
       urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
     HTTP/1.1
   Host: https://example.org

9.1.2.  Processing the Authentication Request

   When the OP receives an incoming authentication request, the OP
   supports OpenID Connect Federation and the incoming client_id is a
   valid URL, the OP should try to resolve and fetch trust chains
   starting with the RP's entity statement as described inSection 7.1.

   The OP should validate the possible trust chains, as described in
   Section 7.2, and resolve the RP metadata with type
   "openid_relying_party".

   The OP should consider the resolved metadata of the RP, and verify
   that it complies with the client metadata specification in OpenID
   Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration].

   Once the OP has the RP's metadata, it can verify the client
   authentication.

9.1.3.  Authentication Error Response

   If the OP fails to establish trust with the RP, it should use an
   appropriate error code, and an "error_description" that aids the RP
   to understand what is wrong.

   In addition to the error codes defined in Section 3.1.2.6 of OpenID
   Connect core, this specification also defines the following error
   codes:

   missing_trust_anchor
      No trusted trust anchor could be found.

   validation_failed
      Trust chain validation failed

   The following is a non-normative example error response:

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     Location: https://client.example.org/cb?
       error=missing_trust_anchor
       &error_description=
         Could%20not%20find%20a%20trusted%20anchor
       &state=af0ifjsldkj

9.2.  Explicit Registration

   This method involves performing an explicit registration of a new
   client the first time a RP interacts with an OP using something that
   basically follows the steps in OpenID Connect Dynamic Client
   Registration 1.0 [OpenID.Registration] but where the client
   registration request is a signed entity statement.

9.2.1.  Provider Discovery

   The RP will start by gathering the OP's metadata using the process
   specified in Section 7 above.

9.2.2.  Client Registration

9.2.2.1.  Client Registration Request

   The OP MUST support OpenID Dynamic Client Registration as extended by
   this specification.  This is signaled by having the claim
   "federation_registration_endpoint" in the OP's metadata.

   Given that the OP supports explicit registration, the RP progresses
   as follows:

   1.  Once it has the list of acceptable trust chains for the OP it
       MUST choose the subset it wants to progress with.  The subset can
       be as small as one trust chain, but it can also contain more than
       one.

   2.  Based on the trust anchors referenced in the subset of trust
       chains, the RP will choose a set of "authority_hints" from its
       own set that terminates in those trust anchors.

   3.  The RP will now construct a self-signed entity statement where
       the metadata statement chosen is influenced by the OPs metadata
       and the "authority_hints" included are picked by the process
       described above.

   4.  The entity statement is sent to the
       "federation_registration_endpoint" defined in this document.

9.2.2.2.  Client Registration Response

9.2.2.2.1.  The OP Constructing Response

   1.  After the OP receives the request, it collects and evaluates the
       trust chains starting with the "authority_hints" in the
       registration request.  After it has verified at least one trust
       chain it can verify that the signature on the received
       registration request is correct.

   2.  If it finds more than one acceptable trust chain, it MUST choose
       one trust anchor from those chains as the one it will proceed
       with.

   3.  At this point, if there already exists a client registration
       under the same entity ID then that registration MUST be regarded
       as invalid.  "Note" that key material from the previous
       registration MUST be kept to make key rollover possible.

   4.  The OP will now construct a metadata policy that, if applied to
       the RP's metadata statement, will result in metadata that the OP
       finds acceptable.  "Note" that the client_id the OP chooses does
       not have to be the same as the entity ID of the RP.  To the
       entity statement it will add one or more "authority_hints", from
       its collection, that terminate in the trust anchor chosen above.

   5.  It will sign and return the registration response (a signed
       entity statement) to the RP.

9.2.2.2.2.  The RP Parsing the Response

   1.  The RP verifies the correctness of the received entity statement,
       making sure that the trust chains starting at the
       "authority_hints" terminates in trust anchors that were
       referenced in the entity statement it sent to the OP.

   2.  The RP MUST NOT apply metadata policies from the trust chains
       that the OP provides because those are not valid for the RP's
       metadata.  The RP MUST apply policies to the metadata using one
       of its own trust chains that ends in the trust anchor that the OP
       chose.  Once it has applied those policies it can the apply the
       policy returned from the OP.  When it has applied all the
       metadata policies to its metadata statement, it then stores the
       result and can continue communicating with the OP using the
       agreed-upon metadata.

   3.  At this point the RP also knows which trust chain it should use
       when evaluating the OP's metadata.  It can therefore apply the
       metadata policies on the OP's metadata using the relevant trust
       chain and store the result as the OPs metadata.

   4.  If the RP was not OK, for some reason, with the received entity
       statement then it has the choice to restart the registration
       process or to give up.

9.2.3.  After client registration

   A client registration using this specification is not expected to be
   valid forever.  The entity statements exchanged all have expiration
   times, which means that the registration will eventually time out.
   An OP can also for administrative reasons decide that a client
   registration is not valid anymore.  An example of this could be that
   the OP leaves the federation in use.

9.2.3.1.  What the RP MUST Do

   At regular intervals the RP MUST:

   1.  Starting with the OP's entity statement, resolve and verify the
       trust chains it chooses to use when constructing the registration
       request.  If those trust chains do not exist anymore or do not
       verify, then the registration should be regarded as invalid and a
       new registration process should be started.

   2.  If the OP's entity statement was properly formed the RP must now
       verify that the entity statement it received about itself from
       the OP is still valid.  Again, if that is not the case the

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


       registration should be regarded as invalid and a new registration
       process should be started.

   What is regarded as reasonable intervals will depend on federation
   policies and risk assessment by the maintainer of the RP.

9.2.3.2.  What the OP MUST Do

   At regular intervals the OP MUST:

   1.  If the signature on the registration request has expired it MUST
       mark the registration as invalid and demand that the RP MUST re-
       register.  Else

   2.  starting with the RP's client registration request, the OP MUST
       verify that there still is a valid trust chain terminating in the
       trust anchor the OP chose during the registration process.

9.2.4.  Expiration Times

   An OP MUST NOT assign an expiration time to a RP's registration that
   is later then the trust chains expiration time.

10.  IANA Considerations

   TBD Register federation_types_supported for OP metadata with initial
   values automatic, explicit.

   TBD Register federation_type for RP registration metadata.

   TBD Register federation_registration_endpoint for the OP metadata.

11.  Security Considerations

Appendix A.  Provider information discovery and client registration in a
             federation

   Let us assume the following: The project LIGO would like to offer
   access to its wiki to all OPs in EduGAIN.  LIGO is registered to the
   InCommon federation.

   The players

                          EduGAIN
                             |
          +------------------+------------------+
          |                                     |
       SWAMID                               InCommon
          |                                     |
        umu.se                                  |
          |                                     |
      op.umu.se                           wiki.ligo.org

   Both SWAMID and InCommon are identity federation in their own right.
   They also have that in common that they both are members of the
   EduGAIN federation.

   SWAMID and InCommon are different in how they register entities.
   SWAMID registers organisations and lets the organisations register
   entities that belong to the organisation, while InCommon registers
   all entities directly and not beneath any organisation entity.  Hence
   the differences in depth in the federations.

   Let us assume a researcher from Umeae University would like to login
   at the LIGO Wiki.  At the Wiki the researcher will use some kind of
   discovery service to find the home identity provider (op.umu.se)




Hedberg, et al.         Expires February 19, 2020              [Page 38]

                        OpenID Connect Federation            August 2019


   Once the RP-part of the Wiki knows which OP it should talk to it has
   to find out a couple of things about the OP.  All if those things can
   be found in the metadata.  But finding the metadata isn't enough the
   RP also has to trust the metadata.

   Let us start with discovering Provider information.

A.1.  The Wiki Discovers the OP's metadata

   Metadata discovery is a sequence of steps that starts with the RP
   fetching the self-signed entity statement of the leaf (in this case
   https://op.umu.se) using the process defined in Section 5.  What
   follows there after is sequence of steps made out of these:

   1.  Pick out the immediate superior entities using the authority
       hints

   2.  Fetch the configuration for each such entity.  This uses the
       process defined in Section 5

   3.  Using the federation API endpoint of the superiors do a fetch
       request Section 6.1.1 on the endpoint.  Asking for information
       about the subordinate entity.

   How many times this has to be repeated depends on the depth of the
   federation.  What follows below is the result of each step the RP has
   to do to find the OP's metadata using the federation set up described
   above.

   When building the trust chain the entity statements issued by a
   superior about its subordinate is used together with the self-signed
   entity statement issued by the leaf.

   The self-signed entity statement concerning intermediates are not
   part of the trust chain.

A.1.1.  Configuration information for op.umu.se

   The LIGO WIKI RP fetches the self-signed entity statement from the OP
   (op.umu.se) using the process defined inSection 5.

   The result is this entity statement.

   This is the second link in the trust chain.

   Notable here is that this path leads to 2 trust anchors using the
   same next step ("https://swamid.se").

   This is the third link in the trust chain.

   This is the entity statement of a trust anchor.  So if the LIGO Wiki
   RP was part of the SWAMID federation we would not have to walk
   further up the tree.  But since it is not we have to go one step
   further.

A.1.6.  Configuration information for 'https://edugain.geant.org'

   RP fetches the self-signed entity statement from
   "https://edugain.geant.org" using the process defined inSection 5.

   {
       "exp": 1568397247,
       "iat": 1568310847,
       "iss": "https://edugain.geant.org",
       "jwks": {
           "keys": [
               {
                   "e": "AQAB",
                   "kid": "Sl9DcjFxR3hrRGdabUNIR21KT3dvdWMyc2VUM2Fr...",
                   "kty": "RSA",
                   "n": "xKlwocDXUw-mrvDSO4oRrTRrVuTwotoBFpozvlq-1q..."
               }
           ]
       },
       "kid":
         "Sl9DcjFxR3hrRGdabUNIR21KT3dvdWMyc2VUM2FraFF5TGVWLW9JX0tZWQ",
       "metadata": {
           "federation_entity": {
               "federation_api_endpoint":
                 "https://geant.org/edugain/api"
           }
       },
       "sub": "https://edugain.geant.org"
   }

   Again the only thing we need is the "federation_api_endpoint".  As
   described in Section 8.2 note should also be taken to "jwks" as the
   trust anchor may be performing a key rollover.

A.1.7.  Entity statement published by 'https://edugain.geant.org' about
        'https://swamid.se'

   The LIGO Wiki RP uses the federation API and the "fetch" command as
   defined in Section 6.1.1 to fetch information about
   "https://swamid.se" from the API endpoint published in
   https://edugain.geant.org's configuration.

           "openid_relying_part": {
               "contacts": {
                   "add": "ops@edugain.geant.org"
               }
           }
       },
       "sub": "https://swamid.se"
   }

   This is the fourth and final entity statement in the trust chain

   We now have the whole chain from the self-signed entity statement of
   the leaf up until the last one which is issued by a trust anchor.
   All in all we have:

   1.  Self-signed entity statement by the leaf (https://op.umu.se>

   2.  Statement issued by https://umu.se about https://op.umu.se

   3.  Statement issued by https://swamid.se about https://umu.se

   4.  Statement issued by https://edugain.geant.org about
       https://swamid.se

   Using the public keys of the trust anchor that the LIGO Wiki RP has
   been provide with in some secure out-of-band way it can now verify
   the trust chain as described in Section 7.2

A.1.8.  Verified metadata for op.umu.se

   Having verified the chain the LIGO Wiki RP can to proceed with the
   next step.

   Merging the metadata policies from the tree entity statements we
   have, by a superior about its subordinate, and applying the combined
   policy to the metadata statement that the leaf entity presented we
   get:

   We have no reached the end of the Provider discovery process.

A.2.  The two ways of doing client registration

   As described in Section 9 there are two ways which you can used to do
   client registration:

   Automatic
      No negotiation between the RP and the OP are made regarding what
      features the client should use in future communication are done.
      The RP's published metadata filtered by the chosen trust chains
      metadata policies defines the metadata that are to be used.

   Explicit
      The RP will access the "federation_registration_endpoint"
      providing the metadata the RP wants to use.  The OP may return a
      metadata policy that adds restrictions over and above what the
      trust chain already has defined.

A.2.1.  RP Sends Authentication Request (Automatic Registration)

   The LIGO Wiki RP does not do any registration but goes directly to
   sending an authentication request.

   Here is an example of an authentication request:

   GET /authorize?
     response_type=code
     &scope=openid%20profile%20email
     &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.ligo.org%2F
     &state=2ff7e589-3848-46da-a3d2-949e1235e671
     &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.ligo.org%2Fopenid%2Fcallback
     &client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs ... qx7xHcvPOdIhnpg
     &client_assertion_type=
       urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
     HTTP/1.1
   Host: op.umu.se

   The OP receiving this authentication request will, unless the RP is
   cached or statically configured, start to dynamically fetch and
   establish trust with the RP.

A.2.1.1.  OP Fetches Entity Statements

   The OP needs to establish a trust chain for the RP (wiki.ligo.org).
   The OP in this example are configured with public key of 2
   federations:

   o  https://edugain.geant.org

   o  https://swamid.se

   The OP starts to resolve metadata for the client identifier
   https://wiki.ligo.org by fetching the self-issued entity statement
   using the process described inSection 5.

   The process is the same as descibed in Appendix A.1 and will result
   in a trust chain with the following entity statements:

   1.  Self-signed entity statement by the leaf (https://wiki.ligo.org>

   2.  Statement issued by https://incommon.org about
       https://wiki.ligo.org

   3.  Statement issued by https://edugain.geant.org about
       https://incommon.org

A.2.1.2.  OP evaluates the RP metadata

   Using the public keys of the trust anchor that the LIGO Wiki RP has
   been provide with in some secure out-of-band way it can now verify
   the trust chain as described in Section 7.2

   I will not list the complete entity statements but only the metadata
   and metadata_policy parts.  There are two metadata policies:

   edugain.geant.org

       "metadata_policy": {
           "openid_provider": {
               "contacts": {
                   "add": "ops@edugain.geant.org"
               }
           },
           "openid_relying_part": {
               "contacts": {
                   "add": "ops@edugain.geant.org"
               }
           }
       }

           "ops@ligo.org",
           "ops@incommon.org",
           "ops@edugain.geant.org"
       ],
       "grant_types": [
           "authorization_code",
           "refresh_token"
       ],
       "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
           "RS256",
           "RS512"
       ],
       "jwks_uri": "https://wiki.ligo.org/jwks.json",
       "redirect_uris": [

       "response_types": [
           "code"
       ],
       "subject_type": "public"
   }

   Having that, the "registration" is done and the OP must now using the
   keys found at the URL specified in "jwks_uri" verify the client
   assertion in the authentication request.

A.2.2.  Client starts with registration (Explicit Client Registration)

   Here the LIGO Wiki RP send a client registration request to the
   federation_registration_endpoint of the OP (op.umu.se).  What it
   sends is a self-signed entity statement.

   Once the OP has the entity statement it proceeds with the same
   sequence of steps as laid out in Appendix A.1.

   The OP will end up with the same RP metadata as was described in
   Appendix A.2.1.2 but what it now can do is return a metadata policy
   that it wants to be applied to the RP's metadata.  This metadata
   policy will be combined with the trust chains combined metadata
   policy before being applied to the RP's metadata.

   If we assume the the OP has a bit more strict view on which type of
   crypto keys to use it may want to add a metadata policy that says.

   "metadata_policy" :
      {
         "openid_relying_part": {
            "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
               "RS512"
           ]
         }
   }

   In which case the metadata used by the RP should be described like
   this:

   {
       "application_type": "web",
       "client_name": "LIGO Wiki",
       "contacts": [
           "ops@ligo.org",
           "ops@incommon.org",
           "ops@edugain.geant.org"
       ],
       "grant_types": [
           "authorization_code",
           "refresh_token"
       ],
       "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
           "RS512"
       ],
       "jwks_uri": "https://wiki.ligo.org/jwks.json",
       "redirect_uris": [
           "https://wiki.ligo.org/callback"
       ],
       "response_types": [
           "code"
       ],

Appendix D.  Open Issues

   The following open issues remain to be addressed in this
   specification.

   o  The representation for RPs that are native applications needs to
      be defined.

   o  How are federation operator keys retrieved?

   o  A mechanism is needed for key rotation of federation operator keys
      for long-term security and maintainability of federations.

   o  A mechanism may be needed for bounding key lifetimes.

   o  Discuss that key IDs may be chosen as the JWK Thumbprint [RFC
      7638] of the key.

   o  Discuss localization of human-readable strings.

   o  SAML2 as used in Research and Education federations uses
      post-/prefix matching on metadata in some cases.  We might need
      something similar or just use regular expressions.

   o  Define the relationship between trust anchors and Federation
      Operators, as people will expect to find the Federation Operator
      term in the specification.

   o  Add a diagram showing the relationships between FOs, orgs, sub-
      orgs, and leaf entities.

Appendix E.  Document History

   [[ To be removed from the final specification ]]

   1.1

   o  Incorporated review feedback from Marcos Sanz.  Major changes were
      as follows.

   o  Separated entity configuration discovery from operations provided
      by the federation API.

   o  Started work on new authentication error codes.

   -08

   o  Incorporated review feedback from Michael B.  Jones.  Major
      changes were as follows.

   o  Deleted "sub_is_leaf" entity statement since it was redundant.

   o  Added "federation_type" RP registration metadata value and
      "federation_types_supported" OP metadata value.

   o  Deleted "openid_discovery" metadata type identifier since its
      purpose is already served by "openid_provider".

   o  Entity identifier paths are now included when using the Federation
      API, enabling use in multi-tenant deployments sharing a common
      domain name.

   o  Renamed "sub_is_leaf" to "is_leaf" in the Entity Listings Request
      operation parameters.

   o  Added "crit" and "policy_language_crit", enabling control over
      which entity statement and policy language extensions MUST be
      understood and processed.

   o  Renamed "openid_client" to "openid_relying_party".

   o  Renamed "oauth_service" to "oauth_authorization_server".

   o  Renamed "implicit" registration to "automatic" registration to
      avoid naming confusion with the implicit grant type.

   o  Renamed "op" to "operation" to avoid naming confusion with the use
      of "OP" as an acronym for "OpenID Provider".

   o  Renamed "url" to "uri" in several identifiers.

   o  Restored Open Issues appendix.

   o  Corrected document formatting issues.

   -07

   o  Split metadata into metadata and metadata_policy

      to "rp_claims".

   o  Added Open Issues appendix.

   o  Added additional references.
