    <abstract>
      <t>The OpenID Connect standard specifies how a Relying Party (RP)
        can discover metadata about an OpenID Provider (OP), and then
        register to obtain relying party credentials. The discovery and
        registration process does not involve any mechanisms of
        dynamically establishing trust in the exchanged information, but
        instead rely on out-of-band trust establishment.
      </t>

      <t>In an identity federation context, this is not sufficient. The
        participants of the federation must be able to trust information
        provided about other participants in the federation. OpenID
        Connect Federations specifies how trust can be dynamically
        obtained by resolving trust based on a common trusted third party.
      </t>

      <t>While this specification is primarily targeting OpenID Connect and
        identity federations, it is designed to allow for re-use by
        other protocols and in other use cases.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification describes how two entities that wants to
        interact can dynamically fetch and and resolve trust and metadata
        about each other, for a given protocol, by the use of third party
        trust issuers.
      </t>

      <t>An identity federation can be realized using this specification by
        the use of one or more levels of trust issuers. A trust issuer is an
        entity, which main purpose is to issue trust statements about entities,
        such as OpenID relying party and providers. This specification does not
        mandate a specific way or restrict how a federation may be built.
        Instead the specification provides the basic technical trust
        infrastructure building blocks needed to build a dynamic and
        distributed trust network such as a federation.
      </t>

      <t>All entities in a federation, including the trust issuers, MUST have
        a globally unique identifier.
      </t>

      <t>Note that a real-world entity like an organisation, a company may be
        represented by more than one entity in a federation.
      </t>

      <t>The OpenID Connect Federation trust chains are relying on
        cryptographically signed <xref target="RFC7517">JWT</xref> documents,
        and the trust chain does not at all rely on TLS in order to
        establish trust.

      <section title="The trust anchor">
        <t>A trust anchor is an entity that a number of entities trust will
          issue correct statements. Why they chose to trust this entity is out
          of scope for this document.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="The trust chain" anchor="trust_chain">
        <t>
          In an OIDC Identity Federation, entities that together builds a
          trust chain can be categorized as:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Trust anchor">An entity that represents a trusted
              third party
            </t>
            <t hangText="Leaf">In an OIDC Identity federation an RP or an OP
            </t>
            <t hangText="Intermediate">Neither a leaf nor a trust anchor</t>
          </list>
          A trust chain begins with a leaf entity's self-signed entity
          statement has zero or more entity statements
          issued by intermediates about subordinates and ends with a
          entity statement about the trust anchor (in the case with zero
          intermediates) or an intermediate issued by the trust anchor
          and finally a self-signed entity statement about the trust anchor.
        </t>
        <t>A simple example: If we have an RP that belongs to organisation A
          who is a member of federation F the trust chain for such a setup
          will contain the following entity statements:
          <list style="numbers">
            <t>
              A self-signed entity statement about the RP published by the RP
            </t>
            <t>
              An entity statement about the RP published by Organisation A
            </t>
            <t>
              An entity statement about Organisation A published by Federation
              F
            </t>
            <t>
              A self-signed entity statement about Federation F by Federation
              F.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          A trust chain MUST always be possible to order such that:
          If we name the entity statements ES[0] (the leaf entity's
          self-signed entity statement) to ES[i] (the trust anchors
          self-signed entity statement), i>0 then:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              The *iss* entity in one entity statement is always the *sub*
              entity in the next.
              ES[j]['iss'] == ES[j+1]['sub'], j=0,...,i-1
            </t>
            <t>
              There MUST always be a signing key carried in the jwks claim in
              ES[j] that can be used to verify the signature of ES[j-1],
              j=i,...,1 .

        </t>
        <t>
          The signing key that MUST be used to verify ES[i] is distributed

      <t>An entity (the Consumer) that wants to establish trust with a remote

        entity ID's of trusted trust anchors together with the public version

        sufficient entity statements to establish at least one chain of trust
        from the remote peer to one or more of the configured trust anchors.
        After that the entity MUST validate the trust chains independently,
        and -- if there are multiple valid trust chains and if the

        <t>Depending on the circumstances the Consumer may either be

          have to fetch it by itself. If it needs to fetch it, it will use the
          process described in <xref target="fetch_statement">Fetch Entity

          , ignoring the authority
          hints that ends in an unknown trust anchor, requesting an entity
          statement about the remote peer from the intermediate.
          If the received entity statement contains an authority hint this
          process is repeated. This time with the *iss* set to the
          intermediates entity ID and the *sub* to be the *iss* of the previous
          query.
          The Consumer should never attempt to fetch

          a trust chain consists of an ordered list of entity

        <t>
          No information in the chain of statements should be used

      <t>As described above in

        each trust chain has a expiration time.
        A consumer of metadata using this specification MUST support
        refreshing a trust chain when it expires.
        How often a consumer SHOULD re-evaluate the trust chain depends on
        how quickly the consumer wants to find out that something has changed
        in the trust chain.

          The trust anchor SHOULD set a reasonable expiration
          time on that statement, such that the consumers will re-fetch the
          entity statement at reasonable intervals. If the trust root wants to
          roll over its signing keys it would have to:

            <t>
              Keep signing the entity statement using
              the old keys for a long enough time period to allow all

          Since we expect the consumers to check the trust chain at regular

      <t>There is two alternative approaches to establish trust between a
        Relying Party and a Provider, what we call implicit and explicit
        registration. Members of a federation or a community
        should agree upon which one to use. While implementations should
        support both methods, deployments may choose to disable one
        of them.

          <t>A client registration using this specification is not expected to
            be valid for ever. The entity statements exchanged all have
            expiration times. Which means that the registration will eventually
            time out. An OP can also for some reason decided that a client
            registration is not valid anymore. To this can be added that the
            entities in the federation, for a number of reasons, over time may
            change how fast their signature will expire, thereby increasing or
            decreasing the lifetime of a trust chain.
          </t>

          <section title="What the RP MUST do">
            <t>At regular intervals the RP MUST:
              <list style="numbers">
                <t>Starting with the OPs entity statement, resolve and verify
                  the trust chains it chose to use when constructing the
                  registration request. If those trust chains don't exist
                  anymore or do not verify, then the registration should be
                  regarded as invalid and a new registration process should be
                  started.
                </t>

                <t>If the OPs entity statement was OK it must now verify that
                  the entity statement it received about itself from the OP is
                  still valid. Again, if that is not the case the registration
                  should be regarded as invalid and a new registration process
                  should be started.

      <section title="User chooses to login at Foodle">
        <t>Let us assume a student from Ume&aring; would like to login at
          Foodle. Some sort of discovery process involves the end user choosing
          an OpenID provider. OpenID Discovery using the e-mail address is one
          option. Foodle presenting a list of available providers for the user
          to choose from is another.
        </t>

        <t>After the discovery process, Foodle knows that the user would like

        <t>Foodle normalizes the entity identifier of the OpenID Provider, and

      <section title="Resolving the provider trust chain">
        <t>In order to establish trust with this provider, the Foodle service
          provider would need to fetch sufficient entity statements to represent
          a complete chain from the self-issued statement to the locally
          configured trust root, which contains SWAMID.
        </t>

        <t>The information found in the authority_hints is critical in order
          to dynamically discover the trust chain. If such hints are not
          present, the relying party may resume to fixed configured trust roots
          to ask for trust statements.
        </t>

        <t>In this example, Foodle now fetches an entity statement from SWAMID
          using the Federation API endpoint of SWAMID, discovered in the
          authority_hints claim.

        <t>Notice that the entity statement about University of Ume&aring;
          also contains an entry for openid_client metadata. This indicates that
          SWAMID expresses this university to be trusted to issue its own OpenID
          clients without the need for registering these directly in SWAMID.
        </t>

        <t>These two entity statements are sufficient to establish a path from
          the local configured trust anchor which trust SWAMID, to the
          self-issued statement from the University of Ume&aring;. Here are the
          steps performed to validate the trust chain:

        <t>

            <t>Use these keys to validate the signature of the signed entity
              statement issued by SWAMID about the University of Ume&aring;
            </t>

            <t>Check that the sub from the trust configuration matches the iss
              value of the first entity statement.

            <t>Extract the jwks entry from this entity statement. These are
              the signing keys of the University of Ume&aring;

            <t>Validate the self-signed statement from University of Ume&aring;
              using the keys found above.
            </t>

            <t>Check that the sub from the previous statement matches the iss
              of the self-issued statement.
            </t>

            <t>Check that the self-issued statement has the iss and sub to be

        <t>Foodle after establishing trust with the University of Ume&aring;
          and extracted a resulting set of metadata, will send an authentication
          request to the OpenID provider. This example involves the implicit
          registration.
        </t>

        <t>Here is an example of an authentication request:</t>

          <t>
            In order to establish trust with this provider, the EEPE service
            provider would need to fetch sufficient entity statements to
            represent a complete chain from the self issued statement to the
            trust anchor that represents the EPEE federations.
          </t>
          <t>
            The authority_hints in the self-signed entity statement points to
            2 trust anchors "https://epee.example.org" and "https://swamid.se"
            of these only the *EPEE* one is interesting. The RP therefor chooses
            to only follow that trust path. The next step being fetching an
            entity statement about "https://op.umu.se" signed by the EPEE
            federation. This is done by doing a fetch entity statement:

            We start with the signed entity statement issued by EPEE about

            <list style="numbers">
              <t>Verify that the *sub* in the entity statement is the OPs entity

              <t>Use these keys to validate the signature of the signed entity

            The output from the trust chain validation is an ordered list of
            entity statements. In order to extract the needed metadata, we need
            to look at the metadata type relevant in the given context. In this
            case, we are establishing trust with an OpenID Provider, and we take
            a look at the *openid_provider* metadata object of the trust chain:

          <t>
            Now when the RP has trusted information about the OP it can do a
            dynamic client registration. To that end it collects information
            about
            itself that it wants to register. This should be no different from
            what a normal OIDC RP does. To this it adds information about the RP
            federation signing keys, the *sub* and *authority_hints*.
            Ones it has all that information it
            creates an entity statement. The result of all this work may look
            something like this:

            To collect the trust chains the OP uses the *authority_hints* in the

            In this case it is only one which points to

            statement that the EPEE federation publishes on the EPEE RP.

      <section title="The RP deals with the registration response">
        <t>
          The RP MUST collect the trust chain ending in the EPEE trust anchor
          and
          verify the correctness of the trust chain but refrain from flattening
          the metadata. This since the entity statement issued by the EPEE
          federation about the UmU OP are only valid for that entity and not
          for the EPEE RP.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the RP is OK with what the OP decided on regarding the RPs
          metadata then it will store this to be used in the following OIDC
          protocol exchange with the OP.
        </t>
        <t>
          In this example the RP decided on one specific trust anchor before
          sending the registration request. If that was not the case but the
          RP chose to send a registration request with more than one
          authority_hint then this is the time when then RP can flatten and
          store the provider metadata. This since the OP MUST choose one and
          only one authority (=trust anchor) for the registration response.
